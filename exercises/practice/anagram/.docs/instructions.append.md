# Implementation

You must return the anagrams in the same order as they are listed in the candidate words.

Unlike other tracks, the Go version of the exercise includes test cases that use UTF-8 (non-ASCII) characters in the strings.
However, with Go's first-class support for UTF-8 given by the `rune` type, that should not bother you too much.
